MozFest
=======
  
## Intro
This repo exists to hold resources and output from a few different music track sessions at MozFest 2014. 
We're essentially building our workshop materials collaboratively with the people taking part. Feel free
to fork and submit pull requests with more ideas, add your work in your own folder to the /output 
folder, etc. 
  
## Goals
If there's one over-arching goal of the music track this year it's to explore the future of music on the
open web — not just audio, sound, or even instrumentation. How can we work together with musicians to 
make the open web a viable and strong platform for music? How can we ensure not just new ways to listen
to music as audience, but new ways for musicians to find sustainability on the open web? In short: what 
does the future of the web look like for artists and audience alike? 
  
## Process
These workshops are open to all skill levels. We're encouraging everything from paper sketches up through
adding new functionality to libraries and everything in between. We'll be happy if the output folder fills 
up with code or with cameraphone snapshots of ideas on post-it notes. No matter who you are, no matter 
your tech level, we want your ideas.
