# Exploring web audio from different perspectives: p5.js (Processing), cashmusic.js, and BBC future media dive into audio in the browser
  
In this session we'll look at a few different approaches to visualization and web audio, with
specific detail around p5.js and cashmusic.js. 
  
### p5.js
**p5.js** is a front-end library  for creating graphic and interactive experiences, based on the 
core principles of [Processing](https://processing.org/). Jason Sigal will lead a detailed look at 
some of the visualization capabilities of p5.js and how it can render audio data to visual 
display.
  
### cashmusic.js
**cashmusic.js** is a library aimed (among other things) at DOM manipulation based on position
in an audio track â€” tweening and changing styles via simple JSON interface. This is a library 
coming out of dormancy, so we'll explore ways of creating free-form DOM manipulated art with 
audio as a canvas. And maybe we'll hack it all kinds of up along the way.
