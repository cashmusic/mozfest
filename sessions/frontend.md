# Building front-end for artists  

With working musicians on hand we'll explore new interfaces and ideas for musician websites.
We'll show you the open source [CASH Music](https://cashmusic.org/) platform and give you basic 
boilerplate to play with via CSS. We'll talk examples of what's worked and talk about new
ways for artists to connect with audience. We'll have paper to sketch new ideas, we'll make
lists of services, and anything goes. Let's come up with some ideas together.
  
Our hope is to collaboratively think about and build new workflows, layouts, and ideas for what
a musician's website can look like on the open web.
